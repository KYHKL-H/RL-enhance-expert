# Implement steps
Here are the implementation steps for Atlanta experiments as an example.
1. Download SafeGraph Open Census Data from https://docs.safegraph.com/docs/open-census-data and replace the folder '/data/safegraph_open_census_data'. Actually, we only need one file in this dataset: '/data/safegraph_open_census_data/data/cbg_b01.csv'.
2. Download the IDs of the CBGs in Atlanta 'Atlanta_Sandy_Springs_Roswell_GA_cbg_ids.csv' from https://covid-mobility.stanford.edu//datasets/ [1] and place it as '/data/Atlanta/Atlanta_Sandy_Springs_Roswell_GA_cbg_ids.csv'.
3. Download the raw contact network data in Atlanta 'Atlanta_Sandy_Springs_Roswell_GA_2020-03-01_to_2020-05-02.pkl' from https://covid-mobility.stanford.edu//datasets/ [1] and place it as '/data/Atlanta/Atlanta_Sandy_Springs_Roswell_GA_2020-03-01_to_2020-05-02.pkl'.
4. Get the average dwelling time and floor space of POIs in Atlanta '/data/Atlanta/parameters_Atlanta.csv' with the method in [1].
5. Get the CBG specific death rate in Atlanta '/data/Atlanta/cbg_death_rates_original_Atlanta' with the method in [2].
6. Run '/code/data_process.py' and get the processed contact network data in Atlanta '/data/Atlanta/Atlanta_Sandy_Springs_Roswell_GA_2020-03-01_to_2020-05-02_processed.pkl'.
7. Run '/code/aggregate.py' and get the community division indexes in Atlanta '/data/Atlanta/community_index_fluid.npy'.
8. Run '/code/process_aggregate.py' and get the aggregated contact network data in Atlanta '/data/Atlanta/Atlanta_Sandy_Springs_Roswell_GA_2020-03-01_to_2020-05-02_processed_aggregate.pkl' and the corresponding sizes and age structures of the communities '/data/Atlanta/aggregate_sizes.npy', '/data/Atlanta/aggregate_ages.npy'
9. Run '/code/train.py' for model training and the model are saved in '/model/Atlanta' for testing and analyzing.
10. Run '/code/baseline.py' for baseline results roll out.

Other Python files in '/code' not mentioned above are imported by the mentioned ones.
